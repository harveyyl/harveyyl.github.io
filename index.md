### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was my favorite because this was the start of my coding journey for the very first time. I learned how to compile and run a hello world program. I also got familiar with pushing my code into Github and sharing it with others. 

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was my favorite because I wrote a program in which the computer converts the measurement of a volume from milliliters in the metric system. This lab was challenging because it confused me. This lab helped me gather a sense of understanding of what it'll be dealing with.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1, was another favorite of mine because this was the first-word game I coded. I created a word game that involves a sentence with blanks, and players will fill in the blanks with their guesses and see if they got it right. It was fun coding this because I learned how to make arguments into code.
